# Depression-Detection-from-Social-Media-Tweets
Mental health is a growing concern, and early detection of depressive tendencies through publicly available posts can contribute to timely support and intervention. The model leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the linguistic features of tweets and classify them as indicative of depression or not.
This model detects from Social Media Tweets using ensemble of three language models - BERT, RoBERTa, and DeBERTa for embedding extraction and utilizes Graph Attention Network(GAT) for complex graph like data of social media.
This code is an implementation of methodology proposed in the research paper "CDME-GAT: Context-Aware Depression
Detection Using Multiembedding and Graph Attention Networks in Social Media Text" presented https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10559883 .
